    <dt>Actomorph body</dt>

    <dd>Long body, long limbs, slender figure and thin bones.<br>
        Low fat percentage: This makes the body shape tight; This is due to the high metabolic rate and burning calories throughout the day. <br>
        Thin, not full muscles: Of course, the ectomorph gains muscle mass when adhering to proper training and diet, but it is not as full as other species.<br>
        Difficulty gaining weight: This type is considered the most difficult to gain weight, so it requires a high-calorie diet.

  <div style="background-color: blanchedalmond;">
    <dt>Mesomorph body</dt>
    <dd>
        Sporty physique: This type tends to build muscle easily and with high physical fitness, with broad shoulders compared to the waist.<br>
        Average burning rate, easy fat loss when adhering to diet and exercise.<br>
        Strong and wide bones: This type has strong and wide bones that can withstand the intensity of exercise, while resisting injuries.
    </dd>

  <div style="background-color: rgb(240, 146, 5);">
    <dt>Endomorph body</dt>
    <dd>
        Strong, developed muscles, such as those of the shoulders and legs, although they are not clearly defined as a result of the fat accumulated on them. <br>
        Wide skeleton.<br>
        Low burning rate: This reduces the speed of burning fat, and thus we find fat accumulated in the abdomen and buttocks area, which makes the body structure circular or oval.
